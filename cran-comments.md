## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* fixed the invalid URLs to fully specified URLs starting with the protocol in 
files: README.md and vignettes/how-to.Rmd. Nothing else has changed.


## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.0.3
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.3
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.


## Notes

Sometimes a Note states that there are UTF-8 and Latin1 marked characters. 
I think it is because of the raw data, and doesn't seem to influence 
the package build on any system (using travis).

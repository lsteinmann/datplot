\title{Create sub-objects for each object in a dataframe (internal)}
\usage{
create.sub.objects(DAT_list, stepsize, calc = "weight", cumulative = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{DAT_list}{a list as prepared by datsteps()}

\item{stepsize}{Number of years that should be used as an interval for
creating dating steps.}

\item{calc}{calculation used for weights (weight / probability)}

\item{cumulative}{TRUE if a column for cumulative weights should be added}
}
\value{
a longer matrix of the same structure to be further processed by
datsteps() with a number of steps for each object
}
\description{
Requires a matrix with 4 named columns as datsteps will
hand to the function:
* "index" (identifier so the values can later be reassigned to their ID and
variable),
* "datmin" (minimum dating as any kind of number),
* "datmax" (maximum dating as any kind of number),
* "weight" (as created by get.weights),
* "step" (empty).
It's expected that dates BCE are displayed as negative values while dates
CE are positive values. Ignoring this will cause problems in any case, that
would be fixed automatically by switch.dating().
